# React App Boilerplate

## Abstract

I created my first react app with the `create-react-app` command. Without any previous react experience, I was confused by
all the file clutter and what was essential vs not, so I decided to create my own react boilerplate. My initial goal was 
to learn more about react and its many possibilities as a framework. However, this journey was more an exploration of webpack, 
babel, et la. It has been my introduction to the world of dependencies, versioning, and config files.

## Takeaways 

- I got comfortable going into documentation and trying to extract that which was meaningful to my interest.
- Google skills leveled up some.
- It increased my awareness of how fast programming and the many tools we make use of are developing.
- Exposed me to a different kind of fun than pure Fron-End Development, one I may possibly enjoy more. 

### More to Come

I plan on creating a tutorial walking through the creation of this boilerplate while also including testing, and possibly typescript
(result may split to it's own repo). Be on the look out for links here. 

Until then, feel free to clone this repo and add on to it. It's purposefully basic to allow for that.
