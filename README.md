# React App Boilerplate

A slightly opinionated React app boilerplate. It includes SASS and TypeScript support,
and a jest testing environment.

## Abstract

Like most, I created my first react app using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.
Confused by the file clutter and with no react experience, I found it difficult to
discern what was essential vs not. When I peeked into the boilerplate files, I
found that the project dependencies had been abstracted away and there was
no place to reference how exactly the project got bundled. Rather than be satisfied
using a tool that I didn't understand, I decided to create my own react boilerplate.
My goal was to learn about react and how it worked as a framework.
However, this journey turned into an exploration of the modern Javascript environment
created by webpack, babel, and eslint. These packages form the foundations to
many projects, and introduced me to the world of dependencies, versions, and
configurations.

## Takeaways

- I got comfortable going into documentation and trying to extract that which
  was meaningful to my learning goals.
- It increased my awareness of how fast programming and the many tools we make
  use of are developing.
- Exposed me to a different kind of fun than pure Front-End Development, one I may
  possibly enjoy more.
- Parcel is an up & coming bundler that could be a happy medium between `create-react-app`
  abstraction and webpack's more involved process.

### More to Come

- I plan on creating a tutorial walking through the creation of this boilerplate.
- A testing environment and typescript support had been added.
